<h1>Mangifera indica</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Mangifera indica, commonly known as mango, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae.</li>
    <li>It is a large fruit tree, capable of growing to a height of 30 metres (100 feet).</li>
    <li>There are two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoes â€“ the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".</li>
</ul>
<h2>USES:-</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The tree is more known for its fruit rather than for its timber. However, mango trees can be converted to lumber once their fruit-bearing lifespan has finished. </li>
    <li>The wood is susceptible to damage from fungi and insects.</li>
    <li>The wood is used for musical instruments such as ukuleles, plywood and low-cost furniture</li>
    <li>Health benefits of mango leaves
        <ul>
            <li>Supports skin health.</li>
            <li>Excellent for hair problems.</li>
            <li>Balance the blood sugar level</li>
            <li>Manage high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Treat gall and kidney stones.</li>
            <li>May treat stomach ulcers and hiccups.</li>
            <li>May help with weight loss.</li>
            <li>May have anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Cultural & Historical Importance:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The mango is inextricably connected with the folklore and religious ceremonies of India. Buddha himself was presented with a mango grove that he might find repose in its grateful shade.</li>
    <li>The name mango, by which the fruit is known in English- and Spanish-speaking countries, is most likely derived from the Malayalam manga, which the Portuguese adopted as manga when they came to Kerala in 1498 for the spice trade. Probably because of the difficulty in transporting seeds (they retain their viability a short time only), the tree was not introduced into the Western Hemisphere until about 1700, when it was planted in Brazil; it reached the West Indies about 1740.</li>
    <li>Important herb in the Ayurvedic and indigenous medical systems for over 4000 years.</li>
    <li>Mangoes belong to genus Mangifera which consists of about 30 species of tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae.   </li>
    <li>According to ayurveda, varied medicinal properties are attributed to different parts of mango tree.</li>
    <li>Mango is one of the most popular of all tropical fruits. Mangiferin, being a polyphenolic antioxidant and a glucosyl xanthone, it has strong antioxidant, anti lipid peroxidation, immunomodulation, cardiotonic, hypotensive, wound healing, antidegenerative and antidiabetic activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<ul><li><b>Watering</b>
<p>Mango trees (Mangifera indica) need to be watered throughout the first two years of their life to supplement rainfall and encourage growth, says the University of Florida IFAS Extension. Each tree needs about 26 gallons of water per week.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Location</b>
<p>It is native tropical Asia and has been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for over 4000 years and is now found naturalized in most tropical countries.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sunlight</b>
<p>Mango trees require full sun, meaning at least eight hours of direct sunlight on most days. Their flower and fruit production will suffer if they don't get enough light. A south-facing window indoors can work, but it's best to move the pot outside as much as possible for full sunlight exposure.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Food</b>
<p>Fertilizer. Potted mango tree does best with small applications of liquid fertilizer every month or so. Look for a fertilizer that's low in nitrogen, higher in potassium and phosphorus, and contains magnesium, like a 6-6-6-2 (N-P-K-Mg).</p></li></ul>
