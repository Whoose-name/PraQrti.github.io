<h1>Eucalyptus globulus</h1>
<h3>-Tasmanian blue gum</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as southern blue gum or blue gum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.     </li>
    <li>It is a tall, evergreen tree endemic to southeastern Australia. This Eucalyptus species has mostly smooth bark, juvenile leaves that are whitish and waxy on the lower surface, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, glaucous, ribbed flower buds arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, white flowers and woody fruit.</li>
    <li>There are four subspecies, each with a different distribution across Australia, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. The subspecies are the Victorian blue gum, Tasmanian blue gum, Maiden's gum, and Victorian eurabbie.</li>
    <li>Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) is a species of evergreen tree that is native to Australia and Tasmania. </li>
    <li>It is one of the most widely cultivated eucalyptus trees in the world and has a rich cultural and historical significance. </li>
    <li>The tree is widely known for its essential oils, timber, and medicinal properties.</li>
    <li>The Tasmanian blue gum is a tall and fast-growing tree, reaching heights of up to 90 meters. </li>
    <li>The tree's bark is a distinctive bluish-gray color, and its leaves are long and narrow, with a blue-green color. </li>
    <li>The tree's flowers are white or cream-colored and bloom during the summer months.    </li>
</ul>
<h2>USES as:-</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Timber: <br> Blue gum timber is yellow-brown, fairly heavy, with an interlocked grain, and is difficult to season. It has poor lumber qualities due to growth stress problems, but can be used in construction, fence posts and poles.</li>
    <li>Pulpwood: <br>Eucalyptus is the most common short fibre source for pulpwood to make pulp. The types most often used in papermaking are Eucalyptus globulus (in temperate areas) and the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis hybrid (in the tropics).</li>
    <li>Essential oil: <br>The leaves are steam distilled to extract eucalyptus oil. E. globulus is the primary source of global eucalyptus oil production, with China being the largest commercial producer</li>
    <li>Herb tea: <br>Tasmanian blue gum leaves are used as a herbal tea. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Cultural & Historical Importance:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In Australia, the Tasmanian blue gum is also an important symbol of the country's natural heritage. The tree has been featured on Australian postage stamps and coins.</li>
    <li>the Tasmanian blue gum is also considered a weed in some parts of the world. The tree's fast growth and ability to spread quickly can cause ecological damage in areas where it is not native.</li>
    <li>In Peru, the blue gum is the main source of poles, railroad ties, and timber for industrial use. </li>
    <li>Ecuador celebrated the genus with a postage stamp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<ul><li><b>Planting:</b>
<p>Tasmanian blue gum prefers well-draining soil and full sun.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Watering:</b>

<ul><li><b>Fertilizers:</b>
<p>Fertilizers should be applied during the growing season to improve growth and yield.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Soil:</b>
<p>Tasmanian blue gum can grow in a variety of soils, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils, but it prefers well-drained, fertile soil. </p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pruning:</b>
