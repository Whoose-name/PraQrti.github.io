According to Tibetan beliefs, the Buddha of the next era will find enlightenment under the white flower canopy of the champaca tree.</li>

    <li>The tree was traditionally used to make fragrant hair and massage oils. Jean Patou’s famous perfume, 'Joy', the second best-selling perfume in the world is derived in part from the essential oils of champaca flowers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<ul><li><b>Water</b>
<p>Champak should be watered immediately after planting, and again when the water has seeped through. Water it a second time 3 days after planting and a third time 5 days after planting. In the hot seasons, a little water can be used in the morning and evening, while other seasons it is not necessary. Pay close attention to checking if the plants survive.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Fertilizer</b>
<p>Organic fertilizer should be applied to the base of the plant in spring to give it extra nitrogen to help it develop leaves and bloom later in the season. Nitrogen-rich fertilizer such as dried-blood meal is recommended, while potassium, such as potash, is suitable for later in the year and can be applied during fall before the tree becomes dormant over the winter.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sunlight</b>
<p>The positioning of your champak is also an important consideration. Despite being able to cope with cooler climates, they will prefer a sunny spot in the garden with some partial shade for protection during the summer months.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pruning</b>
<p>Champak requires little pruning, but a light trim of younger trees during late spring/summer after they have finished blooming is recommended to help shape the plant and encourage more blooms. Remove damaged branches and leggy shoots, and consider the tree shape when pruning. Aim for a balanced, open structure.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Temperature</b>
<p>Champak should be kept in moderate to warm temperatures to avoid damaging early flowering buds, and can withstand weather conditions in hardiness zones 4-9. Mulch around the base can help retain moisture.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Soil</b>
<p>Champak prefers acidic soils, so if gardening in alkaline soil, add a layer of peat to help raise acidity levels. In areas where soil remains wet, Champak can cope with compact, rich soil.
