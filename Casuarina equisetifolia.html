<h1>Casuarina equisetifolia</h1>
<h3>-She-oak</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Casuarina equisetifolia also known as She-oak or Horsetail She-oak(sometimes referred to as the Australian pine tree or whistling pine tree outside Australia), is a she-oak species of the genus Casuarina.</li>
    <li>The native range extends throughout Southeast Asia, Northern Australia and the Pacific Islands; including Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, East Timor, and the Philippines (where it is known as agoho pine)</li>
    <li>The species has been introduced to the Southern United States and West Africa.</li>
    <li>It is an invasive species in Florida,South Africa, India and Brazil.</li>
    <li>It  is an actinorhizal plant able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>USES:-</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Casuarina is widely used as a bonsai subject, particularly in South-east Asia and parts of the Caribbean. Indonesian specimens and those cultivated in Taiwan are regarded among the best in the bonsai world.</li>
    <li>The wood of this tree is used for shingles, fencing, and is said to make excellent hot-burning firewood.</li>
    <li>Among the islands of Hawaii, Casuarina are also grown for erosion prevention, and in general as wind breaking elements.</li>
    <li>The Casuarina leaves are usually used for ornamental purposes in the urban region.</li>
    <li>Other than ornamental purposes, the Casuarina was also explored in for its potential in remediation of textile dye wastewater. Casuarina leaves were found to be useful as absorbent material for the removal of textile dyes</li>
    <li>Casuarina equisetifolia Lin. (Casuarinaceae) has been used traditionally for treating inflammation, cancer and other diseases</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cultural & Historical Importance:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are many places in South Asia and Southeast Asia named after this plant. In Sri Lanka, a famous beach on the Jaffna Peninsula, Casuarina Beach, is named because of the many Casuarina trees that line the coast</li>
    <li>Casuarina is known as ru, rhu or aru in Malay. Many coastal fisherman villages in Terengganu have names such as Ru Renggeh, Ru Dua,Rusila formerly Ru Se Le (Ru Satu Pokok Sahaja "Just One Casuarina Tree"), and Ru Rendang.</li>
    <li>There are many places named because they have a cape (tanjung) where casuarina trees grow there. In Singapore, there is a road named Tanjong Rhu Road because it once had many of these trees growing along the coast from Kallang to Rochor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Watering</b></li>
    <p>It is only required for young plants after they are planted on a permanent planting site and during periods of drought.</p>
</ul>
<ul><li><b>Reproduction</b>
<p>Sowing seeds in the open ground is most often used, followed by selective thinning for two years. During the spring and summer, a complex fertilizer is diluted in water for irrigation and top dressing is used. Cuttings are rarely used.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Location</b>
<p>Plants of the genus Casuarina require an open sunny place.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Temperature</b>
<p>
    Some species, such as the finest casuarina, are resistant to changes in air temperature. Others, such as the dwarf cassowary, are less stable and can only be planted in mild climates. Horsetail cassowary does not tolerate temperatures below 5-7 Â°C.
</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Diseases and pests</b>
<p>Honeydew can provoke root rot and weakening of plants, even lead to death. The affected instance can only be deleted. The disease can be prevented by not planting plants in infected areas.</p></li></ul>
