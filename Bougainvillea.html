<h1>Bougainvillea</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Bougainvillea is a tropical plant that is native to South America but is widely cultivated around the world. </li>

    <li>Cut flowers: Bougainvillea can be used as cut flowers, either fresh or dried, for decorative purposes.</li>
    <li>Medicinal: In some traditional medicinal systems, such as Ayurveda, Bougainvillea is used to treat a range of ailments, including inflammation, wounds, and respiratory infections. However, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cultural & Historical Importance:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In India, Bougainvillea is known as "paper flower" due to the delicate texture of its bracts. It is often used in Hindu religious ceremonies as a decoration for altars and idols.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<ul><li><b>Climate</b>
<p>Bougainvillea prefers a warm, tropical or subtropical climate with full sun exposure. It can tolerate some shade but may produce fewer flowers. It can also tolerate some drought but prefers regular watering.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Soil</b>
<p>Bougainvillea grows best in well-drained soil that is slightly acidic (pH 5.5-6.5). It can tolerate a range of soil types, including sandy or rocky soil, but it does not do well in heavy clay soils.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Water</b>
<p>Bougainvillea prefers moderate watering and can tolerate some drought, but it does not do well in waterlogged soil. It is important to allow the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Fertilizer</b>

<ul><li><b>Pruning</b>
<p>Bougainvillea requires regular pruning to control its growth and shape. It should be pruned after each flowering cycle to encourage new growth and more flowers.</p></li></ul>
