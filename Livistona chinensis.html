<h3>(Chinese fan palm)</h3>
<p>
•Livistona chinensis, the Chinese fan palm or fountain palm, is a species of subtropical palm tree of east Asia.
<br><br>•It is native to southern Japan, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, southeastern China and Hainan. In Japan, two notable populations occupy islands near the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture, Aoshima and Tsuki Shima.
<br><br>•It is also reportedly naturalized in South Africa, Mauritius, Réunion, the Andaman Islands, Java, New Caledonia, Micronesia, Hawaii, Florida, Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
<br><br>•Livistona chinensis can attain heights of about 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) and a spread of 4 m (12 ft). The leaves are fan shaped
<br><br>•The palm is cultivated as an ornamental tree in gardens and conservatories.
<br><br>•This plant can become a weed, or in some ecosystems an invasive species, in places such as Bermuda,Hawaii,Florida wetlands and on some Caribbean Islands.

<h2>USES:-</h2>
<br>
<p>
1)Although the Chinese fan palm has long been used as a container palm, its neat leaf habit and interesting form make it ideal for additional landscape use, such as staggered groupings or as a freestanding specimen or street tree. When planted about ten feet apart along a walk or street, they form a closed canopy.
<br><br>2)They thrive in small soil spaces.
<br><br>3)The palm cleans itself of old leaves and requires little to no pruning.
<br><br>4)Moreover, the Chinese fan palm fruits have been used in traditional medicine as an anticancer agent.
<br><br>5)The seeds and fruits have specific compounds, called phenolic compounds, which have antibacterial properties.
<br><br>6)The leaves are used for making fans
<br><br>7)They are also used for manufacturing rain hats and coats, brooms etc
<br><br>8)The fibres, extracted from the sheath and the petiole of the leaves, are made into cordage

<h2>Plantation:-</h2>
<p><br><b>Watering</b>
<br><br>Chinese fan palms need at least eight hours of direct sunlight on most days, while young palms prefer shade. Indoors, they prefer a bright window with indirect light.
<br><br><b>Soil</b>
<br><br>
Palms can tolerate a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay, with good drainage. For container-grown plants, use a quality potting mix made for palms.
<br><br>

<b>Water</b>
<br><br>
Overwatering Chinese fan palms can lead to root rot and other diseases, so it is important to water them during dry spells and hot weather. During the winter months, allow the soil to dry out for container-grown plants, and increase water during the spring, summer, and fall.
<br><br>
<b>Temperature and Humidity</b>
<br><br>
Chinese fan palms are resistant to cold and frost, and thrive in warm, humid weather. To maintain humidity and prevent foliage from drying out, mist the palm regularly and protect it from drafts and air-conditioning vents.
<br><br>
<b>Fertilizer</b>
<br><br>
Apply palm fertilizer two or three times per year to promote faster growth.
<br><br>
<b>Pruning </b>
<br><br>
The Chinese fan palm does not require pruning, as the terminal tip of the stem is where all new growth originates. Older fronds should be removed if they have turned brown, and sharp pruners should be used to remove any old fronds close to the trunk.
