    <li>Prior to Spanish colonization, the Guaraní people of South America brewed a beer from mashed Carob pods and wild honey.</li>
    <li>The species' uses also include forage, wood and environmental management. The plant possesses an unusual amount of the flavanol (-)-mesquitol in its heartwood.</li>
    <li>In the Macará Canton of Ecuador, P. juliflora can be found in dry forests where it is one of the species most frequently harvested for multiple forest products.</li>
